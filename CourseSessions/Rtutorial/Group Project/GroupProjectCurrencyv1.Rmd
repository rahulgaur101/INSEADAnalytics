## The Business Problem

Analyzing the effects of oil price fluctuations on global current. The idea is to study currencies of nations that fall under the following segments:

--North America <br>
--Asia <br>
--Middle East (OPEC) <br>
--Russia <br>
--Europe <br>

## Gather data

Gather data on crude oil prices and currencies for the time period 2008-2016. We will try to capture as many parameters that affect currency fluctuations 

## Visualize data and see how it can be useful for the analysis

Create relevant plots to study correlation for the period 2008-2016

## Aggregation: Rearrange data in a format that allows pattern recognition

## Build the model and assess model accuracy

## Use the model to make predictions

## Visualize the Results
